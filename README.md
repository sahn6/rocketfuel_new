Installation:
In order to run our rocketfuel you will nead python 2.7 and the following libraries installed:
 * scapy - http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
 * matplotlib - http://matplotlib.org/
 * basemap - https://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/
 * networkX - https://networkx.github.io/
 * Beautiful soup - https://networkx.github.io/
 * python-geoip Geolite2 - http://pythonhosted.org/python-geoip/
 * traceroute - install from linux repository
Then extract all the rocketfuel python files to the same folder.

Running Rocketfuel:
    1.First you must download a list of your target AS servers.
Open in a web browser the site address 
http://bgp.he.net/AS[target ASN]#_prefixes 
(example for 012-smile http://bgp.he.net/AS9116#_prefixes)
    2.And save the page in your Rocketfuel directory under the name as[ASN].htm (Example: as9116.htm)
    3.Open a terminal and go to the Rocketfuel folder. 
Run the program as root by typing: python RocketFuel.py
Rocket fuel will ask you for the AS number you wish to map 
and offer a list of possible geographical maps 
(Israel, USA, Australia and a world map).
    4.From here, Rocketfuel will run its algorithm and print its output 
as it generates it.

Modules:
 (1)RocketFuel.py - the main module of the program, 
                    call for it to run Rocketfuel. 
                    It contains the functions for 
                    dependent prefix, exit, ISP path detection
                    and the functions for printing the ISP graph and geomap.
 (2)SubnetSoup.py - Processes and parses the information 
                    from the as[ASN].htm web page.
 (3)alias_resolution.py - main code of the alias resolution module. 
                          This module try to solve the question "are 
                          in those IP addresses some aliases?"
 (4)group_by_location.py - group IP addresses by their geolocation 
                           for the alias resolution module
 (5)collect_TTL.py - collect informations about addresses for the alias resolution module
 (6)match.py - run tests for the alias resolution module
 (7)matches_help.py - tests for the alias resolution module
 (8)union_find.py - a union find data structure
