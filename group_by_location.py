##	Group IP addresses by their geolocation in order to reduce number of match tests to perform
##


# Group the addresses by geolocation
# PARAMETER dirpath is the path of the directory containing filename - need to be current directory (not used, finally)
# PARAMETER filename is the file with all the IP_addresses list
# RETURN:
# the addresses without geolocation are returned in a set ("without_geolocation")
# those with geolocation are grouped in sets, the sets are grouped in a list ("list_of_all_addresses")

# create a tmp directory "group_by_geolocation" in the current directory
# "group_by_geolocation" contains files 'geolocation.txt'
# each file contains the subList of IP addresses that have the filename's geolocation

# group IP addresses by their geolocation for the alias resolution module
