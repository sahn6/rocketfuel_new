##	Collect responsive addresses and informations on them for future match tests
##


# PARAMETER list_of_all_addresses - list of sets of addresses to collect responsive addresses and ttl
# PARAMETER without_geolocation - another set of addresses that have no geolocation to collect responsive addresses and ttl
# RETURN:
# responsive_addresses - (IP, TTL, inversed_DNS)
# addresses - set of the IP addresses of "responsive_addresses"
# AddressToData - a dictionary. keys are the IP addresses, and data is same as in "responsive_addresses"

# collect the addresses that response, their ttl and DNS name ("llun" if there is not)
# if some have not responded, wait few seconds (TimeToSleep variable) and collect again
# do it again until there are new responses
# remove those that are unresponsive

# collect informations about addresses for the alias resolution module
