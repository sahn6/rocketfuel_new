# PARAMETER dirpath - path of the directory containing the following file
# dirpath is not used finally (must be current directory)
# PARAMETER filename - name of the file in dirpath that contains the IP addresses for checking aliases

# Group the addresses by geolocation
# Collect the addresses that respond, their ttl and DNS name
# Create a dictionnary "AddressToIndex": {IP_address:index} for the responsive addresses
# Create a union-find data structure "unionFind"
# Initially, each address is a group
# For each group of geolocation
# 	# Create all the possible pairs
# 	# Order by ttl_diff increasing, and similarity of DNS decreasing if TTLs equal
# 	# Run over pairs of addresses and take a match decision if it's possible
# Create a dictionary "IndexToAddress": {index:IP_address}
# Create a list of lists "result". Each element 'list' contains aliased IP addresses
# Return unionFind, IndexToAddress, AddressToIndex, result

# main code of the alias resolution module. 
# This module try to solve the question "Are in 
# those IP addresses some aliases?"
